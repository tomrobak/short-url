# Short URL Plugin Translations

This directory contains translation files for the Short URL plugin.

## How to Translate

1. Copy the `short-url.pot` file to a new file named `short-url-{locale}.po` where `{locale}` is your language code (e.g., `short-url-fr_FR.po` for French).
2. Edit the `.po` file with a translation editor like Poedit (https://poedit.net/).
3. Save the file, which will generate both `.po` and `.mo` files.
4. Place both files in this directory.
