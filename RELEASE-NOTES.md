# Short URL - Version 1.2.5 "EnhancedCompat"

This release enhances WordPress 6.7+ compatibility by completely eliminating the translation loading warning and optimizing plugin initialization.

## What's New

- ðŸš€ Improved WordPress 6.7+ compatibility with better translation loading
- ðŸ”§ Fixed early translation loading warning by properly delaying admin class initialization
- âš¡ Enhanced plugin initialization process for better performance

## Details

We've restructured how the plugin initializes to ensure complete compatibility with WordPress 6.7+:

1. Plugin initialization now happens properly on the `plugins_loaded` hook
2. Admin classes now initialize only after translations are properly loaded
3. Text domain loading remains on the `init` hook for optimal timing
4. All components load in the proper sequence, eliminating all warnings

This update builds on our previous compatibility improvements for an even smoother WordPress experience!
