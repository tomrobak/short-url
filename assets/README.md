# Plugin Assets

This directory contains assets needed for the WordPress plugin repository and for the plugin's auto-update functionality.

## Required Files

For proper display in the WordPress plugin repository and in the plugin update screen, add the following files to this directory:

- `icon-128x128.png` - Plugin icon (128×128 pixels)
- `icon-256x256.png` - Plugin icon (256×256 pixels)

## Guidelines

- Icons should be square and have a transparent background
- Banners should have a flat background color or a subtle pattern
- Keep file sizes optimized for the web
- Use the PNG format for icons and JPG for banners

You can create these assets using design tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, or Canva.
